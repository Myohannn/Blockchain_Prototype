# Dynamic-difficulty Proof-of-Work Blockchain System

This project is an implementation of the Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain system developed in Python 3.9 along with
gRPC-python and MongoDB.
It can help beginners to have an in-depth understanding on how the blockchain system works.
You will be able to play around with some basic blockchain features including "Blockchain Prototype Construction", "
Mining Process", "Transaction", "Consensus Network", and "Data Storage".

**Basic Features**

- [x] Blockchain Prototype
- [x] Dynamic-difficulty Proof-of-Work Algorithm
- [ ] Transaction
- [x] Network (gRPC-python)
- [x] Storage (MongoDB)

## Features Explanations
### Blockchain Prototype
Construct the blockchain system according to the following structure.
The block has the following basic content: 

1. Index: the height of the current block
2. Timestamp
3. Previous Block Hash
4. Current Block Hash
5. Difficulty: The number of bits at the beginning of block hash
6. Nonce: The random number used to calculate the block hash
7. Merkle Root of transactions
8. Data: Transactions

### Dynamic-difficulty Proof-of-Work Algorithm
### Transaction
### Network
### Storage
